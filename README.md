# My MongoDB boiler plate

At the moment, it's just me messing around with MongoDB and Mongoose to learn how to use them in future projects

## Infos
If launched via WSL, don't forget to :
 + go to `$MONGO_INSTALL/bin/mongod.config` and change `bindIp:` to `0.0.0.0`
 + use local IPv4 to connect to MongoDB (can be found with `ipconfig`)
